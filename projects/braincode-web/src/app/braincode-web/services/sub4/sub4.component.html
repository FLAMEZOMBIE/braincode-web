    <h2>How development drives eCommerce success</h2>
    <p>
        eCommerce businesses know that user experience and revenue go hand in hand. When users find shopping hard, slow, or confusing, they don’t convert and you don’t get paid.<br><br> That’s why your eCommerce site should be working hard for you – streamlining
        your business and making shopping effortless. But without a well-developed site, you’re trying to build a great experience on shaky foundations.<br><br> BrainCode has developed more than our share of high-performing eCommerce sites. We focus on
        delivering an experience users love, so you can get products off your shelves and into buyers’ carts.

    <h2>Pillars of a great eCommerce experience</h2>
    <p>
        <b>A seamless shopping experience.</b> An eCommerce build must make shopping easy and secure. Pages must load quickly and reliably, with a consistent look and feel, compelling content, and search functionality that meets users’ needs and expectations.<br><br>

        <b>The right integrations.</b> A static site that’s disconnected from your business ecosystem creates data entry work for employees, and irritates customers with out-of-date information and limited features.<br><br>

        <b>Interaction and personalization.</b> Customers expect sites to “remember” them with features such as product recommendations, promos, and a tailored, content-rich experience. And as a customer-facing channel, the richest eCommerce experiences
        offer ready access to real-time support such as live chat.<br><br>
